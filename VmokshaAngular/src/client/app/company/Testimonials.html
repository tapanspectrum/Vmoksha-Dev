								<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<p><span>For more than a year we were working on the Enterprise Vault Promotion and Mailbox Limit Implementation Projects for all sites within the organisation. Step by step we did complete one site after the other. As of now we have completed ALL sites with two exceptions had been completed. Most sites are 100% compliant to the mailbox limit of 1GB. In some sites we have one or two mailboxes still above the limit. This is an tremendous success and a prerequisite to move to Exchange 2010. I would like to take this opportunity to express my congratulations and special thanks to the Vmoksha team.

                                 <p><span>The “turnaround” story of the partnership. When we met in November, QA was just moving out of RED into Yellow status. Then we had 2 people on the project. Today we have 15 people, and are in a bright Green status. This project has become the benchmark for offshoring QA in PeopleSoft.</span></p>
